## Why ML Engineering Agents?

Machine learning engineering is one of the most iterative and trial-heavy disciplines in software. A typical ML workflow involves loading data, selecting models, tuning hyperparameters, debugging training runs, engineering features, and validating results -- often repeating the cycle dozens of times before reaching a competitive solution. This is exactly the kind of work that benefits from autonomous agents: the search space is vast, the feedback loop is well-defined (a metric score), and each iteration follows recognizable patterns.

Yet existing LLM agents approach each problem from scratch. They have no memory of what worked on similar tasks, no way to detect when they are stuck repeating the same failing strategy, and no mechanism to build up domain knowledge over time. On a 10-step Kaggle challenge, a naive agent might spend 7 steps rediscovering that Random Forest without cross-validation underperforms -- something a human practitioner would know to avoid after the first attempt.

**This project addresses that gap.** Built on [MLE-Dojo](https://github.com/MLE-Dojo/MLE-Dojo) -- a Gym-style framework for training and evaluating ML engineering agents on 200+ real Kaggle challenges -- it implements systems that allow agents to learn from their own execution history, build transferable knowledge, and adapt their strategies in real time.

## Key Implementations

The project implements three major systems on top of the MLE-Dojo framework:

### 1. Pattern Analysis System

Located in [`mledojo/agent/aide/pattern_analysis.py`](mledojo/agent/aide/pattern_analysis.py). See also [`PATTERN_ANALYSIS.md`](PATTERN_ANALYSIS.md) for the full design document.

After every few solution attempts, this system automatically analyzes what the agent has tried so far:

- **Feature Extraction** -- Detects which models (XGBoost, LightGBM, neural networks, etc.), preprocessing techniques (scaling, encoding, imputation), validation strategies (cross-validation, stratification), and hyperparameter methods (grid search, Optuna, Bayesian) each solution used.
- **Pattern Discovery** -- Clusters similar solutions using K-means to identify distinct strategy families (e.g., "tree-based models with grid search" vs. "neural networks with feature engineering").
- **Correlation Analysis** -- Classifies patterns as high-performing, low-performing, risky (high variance), or stable (consistent results), backed by statistical evidence.
- **Insight Generation** -- Converts analysis into actionable guidance injected directly into the agent's prompts: *"Avoid random_forest without proper validation -- scores 52% lower than best approaches"* or *"Continue using XGBoost with cross-validation and feature engineering."*
- **Stagnation Detection** -- A temporal analyzer monitors whether scores have plateaued or solution diversity has dropped, and triggers the agent to explore fundamentally different approaches.

Analysis runs every 3 steps and the resulting insights are automatically added to both drafting and improvement prompts.

### 2. Idea Extraction and Knowledge Base

Located in [`mledojo/agent/aide/idea_extraction.py`](mledojo/agent/aide/idea_extraction.py). See [`example_idea_extraction.py`](example_idea_extraction.py) for a demo.

While Pattern Analysis operates on raw code features, the Idea Extraction system works at a higher level of abstraction:

- **AST-based Code Analysis** -- Parses solution code to extract structural patterns: pipeline architectures, ensemble methods, feature engineering approaches, validation schemes, and optimization strategies.
- **Natural Language Extraction** -- Pulls conceptual ideas from the agent's planning text (e.g., "use stacking with diverse base learners").
- **Knowledge Base** -- Stores abstract ML concepts as structured objects with metadata: confidence scores, success rates, temporal context, prerequisites, and relationships between ideas.
- **Topic Modeling** -- Uses LDA/NMF to discover recurring themes across solutions.
- **Semantic Search** -- Optionally uses sentence-transformers to retrieve relevant ideas by meaning rather than keyword match.

The knowledge base tracks which ideas have been tried, how well they performed, and which ideas tend to work well together -- enabling the agent to make more informed decisions about what to try next.

### 3. Enhanced AIDE Agent Variants

Three variants of the AIDE agent that integrate the above systems:

| Variant | File | Focus |
|---------|------|-------|
| **Main** | [`agent.py`](mledojo/agent/aide/agent.py) | Pattern analysis integration with the standard AIDE draft/improve loop |
| **RK-1** | [`agent_rk_1.py`](mledojo/agent/aide/agent_rk_1.py) | Experimental variant with alternative solution selection |
| **RK-2** | [`agent_rk_2.py`](mledojo/agent/aide/agent_rk_2.py) | Most feature-rich variant with full idea extraction and pattern analysis |

All three build on the AIDE (AI-Driven Exploration) scaffold, which generates initial solution drafts and iteratively refines them based on execution feedback. The enhanced loop injects learned patterns and accumulated knowledge into each iteration's prompts.

### 4. Execution Infrastructure

- **[`run.py`](run.py)** -- Docker task manager that orchestrates experiments across multiple GPUs. Dynamically assigns tasks to available GPU slots, enforces runtime limits, streams container logs, and handles graceful shutdown with full cleanup.
- **[`main.py`](main.py)** -- Unified entry point supporting all agent types (MLE, AIDE, OpenAI, Dummy) with CSV tracking of scores and prompts at each iteration, configurable timeouts, and signal-based termination handling.
- **[`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile)** -- NVIDIA CUDA-based image with Python 3.11 and all dependencies pre-installed.
- **[`run_local.sh`](run_local.sh)** / **[`run_api.sh`](run_api.sh)** -- Scripts for local model serving via vLLM and external API configuration.

## 📇 Data Preparation
MLE-Dojo currently supports **200+** Kaggle competitions.
We aggregate 68 competitions from MLE-Bench (excluding 7 tasks that are unavailable, excessively large, or tightly coupled with specific packages), 74 from DSBench, and 75 additionally scraped and prepared carefully from Kaggle's official website. After removing duplicate entries across sources, we obtain a diverse collection of over 200 unique tasks.

### Install the Kaggle package with pip and setup:
```bash
pip install kaggle
```
Next, go to your Kaggle account settings, generate a new API token, and move the downloaded kaggle.json file to `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json` on Linux/macOS or `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.kaggle\kaggle.json` on Windows. Refer to [Kaggle API](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api) for details.

### Accept terms and conditions
Before downloading each competition, you may need to manually accept its terms and conditions on its official Kaggle website. We provide the competition details in `prepare/*.json`, including website urls, in ascending order of competition data sizes. Feel free to prepare and play with any competition you want!

**❗️Note: This action is needed for each competition you want to prepare and utilize.** 

To prepare newly introduced or MLE-Bench competitions, specify the `competitions-file` (a txt file with each line corresponding to a competition), `data-dir` and the `logs-dir`. We actively maintain and update supported competitions in `prepare/mle.json`. 
```bash
PYTHONPATH="." python prepare/mle.py \
  --competitions-file prepare/competitions.txt \
  --data-dir ./data/prepared \
  --logs-dir ./data/prepare_logs
```
Alternatively, you can specify the `competitions` to prepare via args.
```bash
PYTHONPATH="." python prepare/mle.py \
--competitions random-acts-of-pizza \
--data-dir ./data/prepared \
--logs-dir ./data/prepare_logs
```
To prepare the DS-Bench data, specify paths for raw data and prepared data. This will prepare all the competitions in `prepare/dsbench.json`
```
PYTHONPATH="." python prepare/dsbench.py \
--raw-dir ./data/raw \
--prepared-dir ./data/prepared
```
⏰ Reminder: The data preparation is both time- and space-consuming. Please allocate sufficient resources based on the data size and ensure you have accepted the competition's terms and conditions on the official website in advance.

## 🚀 Quick Start in Python
Here's a quick example to show how to interact with MLE-Dojo:

### 1. Import from `mledojo` and register
```python
from mledojo.gym.competition import CompetitionRegistry, CompInfo
from mledojo.competitions import get_metric
from mledojo.gym.env import KaggleEnvironment

competition_name = "random-acts-of-pizza"
data_dir = ...
output_dir = ...

# register the competition
registry = CompetitionRegistry()
registry.register(
    name=competition_name,
    data_dir=data_dir,  # "random-acts-of-pizza/data"
    comp_info=CompInfo(
        category="General",
        level="beginner",
        output_type="submission.csv",
        higher_is_better=True
    ),

)
```
### 2. Initialize the environment and start interacting with it
```python
# initialize the env
env = KaggleEnvironment.make(
    competition_name=competition_name,      
    output_dir=output_dir,         
    competition_registry=registry,                  
    score_mode="position",

code_to_execute = f'''
import pandas as pd
submission = pd.read_csv('{absolute_data_dir / "public" / "sample_submission.csv"}')
submission.to_csv('{absolute_output_dir / "submission.csv"}', index=False)
print("Submission created successfully.")
'''
env.step("execute_code", **{"code": code_to_execute})
```

## 💽 Run Experiments
We support running experiments both with and without Docker. We recommend Docker for running experiments with our supported agent scaffolds and models.

### Manage LLM API Keys
Create `.env` under the main directory and save API Keys. "HF_TOKEN" is used for local models.
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=""
GEMINI_API_KEY=""
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=""
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=""
XAI_API_KEY=""
HF_TOKEN=""
```
We also support Azure Openai API in `mledojo/chat/utils`, you can leave `OPENAI_API_KEY` blank and fill `AZURE_API_CONFIG` with corresponding information.

### Run with Docker
After getting some competitions prepared, you can get started with running experiments on your prepared data.
Experiment with `o3-mini` and `MLE Agent` scaffold on prepared `random-acts-of-pizza` competition or competitions in `prepare/competitions.txt` (replace `--competitions random-acts-of-pizza` with `--competitions-file prepare/competitions.txt`):
```bash
python run.py \
    --gpu-indices 0 \
    --max-tasks-per-gpu 1 \
    --competitions random-acts-of-pizza \
    --docker-image mle-dojo \
    --task-runtime-seconds 43200 \
    --kaggle-data ./data/prepared \
    --log-dir ./results/logs \
    --output-dir ./results/output
```

### Run without Docker
We also support running experiments without Docker, refer to `main.py` for more args:
```python
python main.py \
    --output-dir ./output \
    --data-dir ./data/prepared \
    --competition-name random-acts-of-pizza \
    --agent-type mle
```
### Configs and Settings
We use separate configs for **Agent** and **Experiment**. Config Path for **Agent** is `mledojo/agent/*/config.yaml` and **Experiment** Config is `config.yaml`. 
**MLE Agent** scaffold supports most mainstream LLMs through API or local serving.

For running local models, refer to `run_local.sh`. We use [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) for local model serving.


### Agent Scaffolds and Packages
We currently support:
1. Agents with originally supported action space in `mledojo`, named **MLE Agent**.
   
2. [AIDE](https://github.com/WecoAI/aideml) (AI-Driven Exploration), an LLM agent that starts by generating a set of initial solution drafts and then iteratively refines and improves them based on performance feedback. We modify the source of the feedback from direct code outputs to `mle-dojo` environment feedback.
   
3. [OpenAI Agents](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/), a package that enables building agentic AI apps with abstractions. We implement a version of **MLE Agent** with `openai-agents` package.

## 🌟 Develop with `mledojo`

### `mledojo` Interface and APIs
We provide [quick examples](example/example.ipynb) of APIs.
MLE-Dojo provides flexible Gym-style APIs that allow users to build personalized environments, introduce new datasets and develop/utilize different agent scaffolds.
Specifically, `mledojo` serves a powerful and flexible toolkit for interacting with machine learning competitions, designed for ease of use and extensibility. Its core components offer a seamless development experience:

1. **`Interface`**: Provides the primary way to interact with a competition. It manages distinct sub-interfaces for specific tasks:
    *   `InfoInterface`: Fetches competition details (overview, data structure, etc.).
    *   `CodeValidationInterface`: Performs **safe, preliminary checks** on user code syntax and basic runtime behavior within a sandbox.
    *   `CodeExecutionInterface`: Manages the **full execution of user code** within the sandbox, handles submission generation, and triggers evaluation.
    *   **Flexibility**: The `Interface` is **modular**, allowing developers to easily **register custom interaction components** tailored to specific needs.

2. **`Sandbox`**: Ensures **secure and fair code execution** by running user scripts in an isolated environment with **configurable resource limits** (GPU, memory, time).

3. **`FeedbackManager`**: Processes the results from validation and execution, generating **structured and informative feedback**.
    *   **Extensibility**: Designed to be extensible, allowing the **registration of custom feedback providers** (e.g., LLM-based analysis, specific error pattern detection) alongside the default `BaseFeedback`.

4. **`KaggleEnvironment`**: The main entry point, wrapping all components into a **standardized, Gymnasium-compatible environment**. It orchestrates the entire workflow (setup, action handling via `step`, state tracking, feedback generation) providing a consistent API for users or automated agents.

MLE-Dojo combines well-defined interfaces, secure execution, structured feedback, and centralized management within a familiar Gym-style environment. Its **modular and extensible design** grants developers significant flexibility to adapt and build upon the core framework.

### Collect trajectories for training
MLE-Dojo provides a detailed history management system and a well-defined reward feedback mechanism, including both final outcome rewards and intermediate step rewards. This design enables flexible use for model training via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning (RL).
We provide both [**Agent History**](trajectories/agent_trajectory.json) and [**Environment History**](trajectories/env_history.json) structures.
